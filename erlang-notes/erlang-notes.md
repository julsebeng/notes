# About Erlang
- Like in math, variables in Erlang are *immutable*.
    - Consequently, like math, calling a function with a particular value will always produce the same output - this is *referential transparency*.
- Erlang emphasizes concurrency and reliability 

>"Erlang has this very pragmatic approach with functional programming : obey its purest principles (referential transparency, avoiding mutable data, etc), but break away from them when real world problems pop up."
